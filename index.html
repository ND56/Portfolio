          <p>I'm a junior web developer currently enrolled in a three-month immersive web development course at General Assembly. <br /><br />Prior to this, I practiced civil litigation as an attorney at a large firm in Boston for about three-and-a-half years. During that time, I realized that I wasn’t passionate about the practice of law—which led me to reconsider my career choice. Programming sparked my interest in part because the same skill set that supported my legal career translated very well to coding: I’m extremely detail-oriented; I tend toward a very structured, logical style of thinking and problem-solving; I’m motivated; and I’m curious. I fell in love with development after spending a few months teaching myself to code, after which I decided to transition away from practicing law—and I haven’t looked back! <br /><br />Moving forward, I’m eager to dive into the field of programming. I’m planning to start with web development, but I hope to continue to learn new languages and really diversify my experiences. Over the course of my career, I hope to move from someone who passively employs code, to someone who actively contributes to this constantly-evolving field.</p>
